Redux + Immutable Video Project
========

####This is the repository for the project we'll build together for the "Redux + Immutable" course in React.js Program, for more information on the program [click here](http://reactjsprogram.com)

## Notes
Every video is coincided with a branch. If you want to compare your code with mine or you just want to play around with the code, check out the different branches on this repository.

# YES It's all good but...

Alright I was learning redux with this project, and I think... I am tired! I realized that I don't have to literally copy what Tyler is doing on the screen - I realized it's much - MUCH better off just watching him code, trying to understand _AND_ perhaps later, I might just implement my comprehension.

**So.**

Dear future me,

I left this repository so that you can use this repository to implement whatever project that you want to implement in the future, **AFTER** learning the full Redux. Change, modify, **DO EVERYTHING**. Perhaps leaving the branch the way it is may be a better idea.
It's like building a project out of stack of experiment. So at least I don't waste my effort trying to follow Tyler's tutorials.
